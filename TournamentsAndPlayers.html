        <p class="textBlock">Tournaments are often organized by <strong>gender</strong> and <strong>number of
                players</strong>. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles,
            where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with
            upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Examples of this include the Orange Bowl
            and Les Petits As junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as
            wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis.</p><br>
