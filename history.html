      A Brief History of Tennis:
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages. The modern form of tennis
        originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to
        various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real
        tennis. </p>

      <p>
        The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server
        had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent
        addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a
        point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.

        Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th-century northern France, where a ball was struck
        with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the palm"), which
        evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern
        style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris
        "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe.

      <p>
        It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the
        French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an interjection used as a call
        from the server to his opponent.[ It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played
        indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is
        now known as real tennis.

    <h2 class="thirdBanner">Origins of Modern Tennis</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.

        The invention of the first lawn mower in Britain in 1830 is believed to have been a catalyst for the preparation
        of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the
        codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.
