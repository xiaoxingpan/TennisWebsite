            The only equipment you need to play a tennis match is a tennis racket, tennis shoes, a tennis ball, and a
            tennis
            court with a regulation net.

            Your racket is like an extension of your arm that you will use to reach and guide
            the ball strategically against your opponent. <br><br><em>Rackets come in many weights, shapes, and sizes
                (not to mention
                the various types of string and tension available), so it’s important to choose the best racket for your
                game.</em>

            6 Factors To Consider When Buying A Tennis Racket

        <p class="underImg centered">For tennis players, choosing the right racket can greatly impact your game.
            <br>There are six factors to consider
            when choosing the best racket type for your skill level:<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="textBlock">
            1. <strong> Head size.</strong> Racket head sizes are available in standard, midplus, oversize, and super
            oversize. A larger head size means more power for the player. A larger racket head also offers a larger
            sweet
            spot area, resulting in a lower margin for error. However, the larger the head size, the less the player can
            maneuver the racket, which means less control. A smaller head size
            will lose some of that power but make up for it in control. <br>
            <br>
            2. <strong>Length.</strong> A standard adult racket length is 27 inches (with 29 inches as the maximum
            length
            allowable for tournament play). An extra inch or two in your racket size can make all the difference in
            providing leverage for your serves and more reach for your groundstrokes. However, longer rackets have
            higher
            swingweight, which means less maneuverability. For children between the ages of four and 10 (or for heights
            between 40 and 55 inches), racket lengths are usually around 19 to 26 inches.<br>
            <br>
            3. <strong>Weight.</strong> You can choose between head-light rackets or head-heavy rackets. Each is defined
            by
            its swingweight, or the level of resistance your racket encounters while swinging around a center of
            rotation. A
            heavier racket has a higher swingweight, which means less acceleration (but an increase in power, stability,
            and
            shock reduction). A lighter racket means a lower swingweight, which means you can whip it faster to generate
            sharp angles and intense topspin (but less power). When choosing a racket, keep in mind that you’ll be
            swinging it in many
            directions throughout the whole match, so pick the one that best suits your strength level and playing
            style.<br>
            <br>
            4. <strong>Grip size.</strong> The right grip size depends on the size of your hand, and what you’re
            comfortable
            holding. If a grip is too small, the handle will twist and move around in your hand, requiring more strength
            to
            keep it steady (which can lead to an inflammation of the tendons by your elbow, commonly known as tennis
            elbow).
            If the grip is too wide, you won’t be able to hold it securely enough to swing properly—this can also
            contribute
            to tennis elbow. <br>
            <br>
            5. <strong>Tension.</strong> Even if you find the perfect racket, you likely won’t be able to just pick it
            up
            and start playing. The strings of the racket are just as important as the racket itself—the tension of the
            strings can change how you hit the ball. Every racket usually has a recommended tension level for the
            stringbed
            printed on the side. Tension level, however, is a matter of personal preference and depends on your style of
            gameplay. Lower tension means the strings are more flexible and will allow the racket to generate more of
            the
            power. Tighter tension means stiffer strings, which will grant you more control but force you to provide
            more of
            your own power.<br>
            <br>
            6. <strong>Stiffness.</strong> Some rackets provide a bit more give than others, which can drastically
            change
            how you hit the ball. Rackets are ranked on a scale of stiffness, as low as 50 for more flexible rackets,
            and
            over 80 for stiffer versions. Most standard rackets you can buy at a pro shop or online rank between 60 and
            75.
